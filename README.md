# IRIS system

IRIS stands for "Integration of Remote systems Into Sormas" and is intended to be the central point of mediation between the various contact, event and guest tracking apps on the one hand and the Sormas instances in the health departments on the other.

This repository is used to manage the development of IRIS.
